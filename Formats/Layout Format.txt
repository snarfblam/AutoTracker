Tracker layout file format.

-File may included embedded resource files, encoded in Base64.
    -Embedded files may be referenced by prefixing the path with "!/" or "!\", e.g. { "background" : "!/main-bg.png"}
-As noted below, some elements may optionaly "share data". Changes made to one object affect all objects that share data.
-Multiple backgrounds may be specified, each corrosponding to a "level"
-"Indicators" are icons that support multiple "levels". Each level uses a different background image as a source.
    -The default level, 0, uses the default background, i.e. the first in the list.
    -Each successive level grabs the icon from the next background in the list.
    -Indicators in different layouts that share a name share data.
-Maps are more complex entities that behave as a grid where each cell can function as an indicator and/or have a marker overlaid
    -Map background/indicator tiles should be opaque. For transparency, use markers.
    -Maps use named sets of markers.
        -A marker set acts as a layer over a map. Each cell in the map can be empty or contain one marker with a level-based image
            -Multiple markers in the same location but may be problematic as they can't be manipulated individually
            -The level of the marker is independant from the level in the underlying map
        -Each named set of markers can specify an initial state (for example, a marker could be placed on the map for each item in the game world)
        -Sets may be shared across multiple maps and/or multiple layouts
        -A marker set name can be used without defining the markers. It will simply be treated as a set that is initially empty.
        -A more technical explanation of markers: they have the following requirements and support the following operations.
            -Each named marker set must be defined.
            -
    -Multiple markers in the same location will be drawn in the order that they're added. 
        -To change the order markers in the same location are drawn, remove all markers in the same location and re-add them in the desired order, bottom to top.
    -Maps can also use a named state for indicators. Mutiple maps with the same state name will share data (indicator levels) to the extent that their grids overlap.
        -For example, a small layout with a minimap can share map level data with an expanded map view
    -Marker levels and indicator levels can be used for any desired purpose. E.g.
        -Map indicator levels could be used to indicate whether a location has been visited
        -Map marker levels could be used to indicate what, if anything, is found at a map location (0 = save location, 1 = health refill, 2 = shop, etc)
    -The tracker may automatically maniplulate map cell levels and markers, allow the user to manually do so, or both
    -A map may either use the background on which it resides, or specify its own
        -If it uses the underlying background, it will use the region over which it sets
        -If it specifies its own background, it will align the top-left corner the background image with the top-left of the map
-A file may specify one layout, or many. In the case of many, the tracker may allow automatic, manual, or both modes of layout selection
-While many aspects of the file are open-ended, it is perfectly legitimite for a tracker to require properties that are listed as optional here
    - E.g. a tracker very well may be for a specific game and thus have requirements for which backgrounds, maps, and indicators are present.
-"Identifiers" in tracker layout files must not start with an underscore.
    - This includes indicators, maps, embedded files, and state names, or, essentially, everything.
    - Trackers are encouraged to use underscore-prefixed
-Notes about graphics:
    - Layout and map backgrounds should be fully opaque
    - Markers may use semi-transparency
    - Indicators should not overlap with eachother or maps

-This specification defines data structes to be encoded in json. Data structure names are wrapped in <angle brackets>
-This specification is not in JSON format. The file is expected to be proper JSON.
-Optional properties will have a question mark appended, e.g. "optionalProperty? number"
-Some objects are allowed to have arbitrarily named properties, displayed in (parens)
    -Typically multiple such properties will be allowed in such objects, in which case
     there will be an following the property specification, e.g. "expectedProperty: { (abritrary)...: string }"
-C-style comments are used to document properties
