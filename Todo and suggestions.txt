Todo:
    - Remove stamp pickers from Form1
    - Maintain corresponding stamp selection for each map (probably keep a dictionary<string, int> that is updated each time the layout changes
    - Remove redundancies in tracker file format.
        - E.g. allowing to specify attributes of a map in either the map definition or the placement makes for confusion
        - Is there even a need to define and place maps separately? It's intended as a convenince for when the same map appears on multiple layouts, but may not be worth the trouble.
    - Change map marker set stacking to map marker set replacement (this will probably become irrelevant if redundancies are removed anyways).
    - There can be up to three bomb upgrades. Layout image needs to account for this.
    - Change bomb icon (for example, +4, +8, +12 instead of stacking bomb images)
    - Refactor UI management in Form1. Has become increasingly adhoc and messy with each update.

Suggestions:

-Zilla:
    - 1/4-sized stamps or smaller, non-grid-locked stamps, e.g. to mark shop with specific items, or heart-locked item
    - Place upper tracker indicators on map somehow (more freedom to clearly mark things)
    - checkbox next to item for "obtained", clicking item sets it as paint.
    - Separate set of items for stamps.
    - Different buttons for "set as brush" and "mark as obtained"

    - I was thinking that you could drag an item to the spot it's in, then when you get it, click on the item and it turns gray.
    + (Re: bomb icon) you could make it one bomb, but with +4 and +8
    - Make a stamp for a portal (i.e. you saw a flashing white dot) and an unknown dungeon (i.e. you were looking at the minimap and saw a solid white dot)
    - Can you change the map image so the places have more distinguishable features?
    - i noticed your tracker doesn't have second quest locations. Maybe we can add that later.
    + Delete stamp on right click, instead of changing it to selected, or deleting if it is already same as selected
    + It instantly goes to triforce when I get the compass
    + there should be a triple bomb since there are three bomb upgrades at max
    + Also there's kraid/ridley compasses that you should probably add.
