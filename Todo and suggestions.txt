Suggestions:

-Zilla:
    - 1/4-sized stamps or smaller, non-grid-locked stamps, e.g. to mark shop with specific items, or heart-locked item
    - Place upper tracker indicators on map somehow (more freedom to clearly mark things)
    - checkbox next to item for "obtained", clicking item sets it as paint.
    - Separate set of items for stamps.
    - Different buttons for "set as brush" and "mark as obtained"

    - I was thinking that you could drag an item to the spot it's in, then when you get it, click on the item and it turns gray.
    + (Re: bomb icon) you could make it one bomb, but with +4 and +8
